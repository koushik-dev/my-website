First thing we wanna do in a blog site is to display all the blogs in a page so that the user can navigate to required blog post.  
\
We need couple of things to clarify before we start achieving this.  
<br/>
- _Need cards to display in the page_.  
- _Cards click should navigate to respective blog post_.
