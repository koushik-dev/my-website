\
This is my personal blog site where i planned to post blogs regarding how i construct this site.  
\
I planned to post a blog about what changes i made to the site with what technology and how i got that idea.  
\
My initial intention is that i will get an idea about my development structure and later realized that this may help the community also.  
\
I prefer to have short blogs with code snippets about the changes. The blogs will discuss about the new tech stack that is added to the site.  
\
This is a very basic structure which will be discussed in the following blog posts.  
\
Thanks
